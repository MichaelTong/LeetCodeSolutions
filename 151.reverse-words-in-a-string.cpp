 * Testcase Example:  '"the sky is blue"'
 *
 * Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
 * 
 * A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will
 * be separated by at least one space.
 * 
 * Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single
 * space.
 * 
 * Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces
 * between two words. The returned string should only have a single space
 * separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "the sky is blue"
 * Output: "blue is sky the"
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "  hello world  "
 * Output: "world hello"
 * Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing
 * spaces.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "a good   example"
 * Output: "example good a"
 * Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a
 * single space in the reversed string.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "  Bob    Loves  Alice   "
 * Output: "Alice Loves Bob"
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "Alice does not even like bob"
 * Output: "bob like even not does Alice"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
 * s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces '
 * '.
 * There is at least one word in s.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * 
 * Could you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?
 *
